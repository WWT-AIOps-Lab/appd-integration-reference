To do this simply use the url from the "Embed Widget" menu in a widget that is part of an existing ThousandEyes dashboard.

**Note** - only the URL is needed, not the full iframe code.

Paste the URL in AppDynamics dashboard wiget under the `URL to display` field in AppD Widget. Make sure `Security Sandbox IFrame` is unchecked.
