# AppD Reference Integration

This project is a reference example of how to integrate ThosandEyes and AppDyanmics. It includes the following integration points:

* Example of setting up and handing ThousandEyes Alerts in AppD and how to setup AppD policies to respond to ThousandEyes alerts

* How to create an AppD Custom Monitor for sending ThousandEyes test data to AppDynamics via Custom Metrics and/or AppDynamics Analytics API. 

* Triggering ThousandEyes Snapshot from AppDynamics - configure AppDynamics to trigger a ThousandEyes snapshot based on a AppDynamics alert policy. 

* ThousandEyes Synthetic Test Injection - make AppDynamics aware of ThousandEyes network traffic that is targeting monitored applications. This allows AppD to perform more detailed tracing for traffic originating from ThousandEyes, allows filtering on ThousandEyes data, and correlating with AppD data. This must be configured manually when creating ThousandEyes tests.
