# AppD Machine Agent ThousandEyes Custom Monitor

This code is an example of a an AppD Machine Agent Custom Monitor for ThousandEyes that streams ThousandEyes metrics to AppD. This ThousandEyes Custom Monitor runs a Python script that periodically pulls test data from the ThousandEyes API and pushes data into AppD via:

* Analytics API or
* Custom Metrics 

Note that while the Analytics API approach doesnâ€™t require using an AppD Machine Agent, the Machine Agent Custom Monitor mechanism provides a convenient, simple, and reliable way to query the ThousandEyes API and push data to the Analytics API. For this reason, the example integration features using the Custom Monitor for both approaches.
